On the Raspberry Pi running Debian, install the Mono framework.
> sudo apt-get install mono-complete

On a development machine, install Xamarin Studio, a.k.a. MonoDevelop (available for Windows, Linux and MacOS from www.monodevelop.com).

In Xamarin Studio, build the project and deploy its output to the Pi. Using Samba to set up a shared drive accessible from the development machine.

On the Pi, run the project's executable with the following command, using the local address of the PI and any available Port number.
> sudo mono --debug --debugger-agent=transport=dt_socket,address=[Pi local address]:[port number],server=y Pibrella.exe

In Xamarin Studio, run the project with the 'Custom Command Mono Soft Debugger' (under Run > Run With), setting the local address of the Pi as IP and the port number used in the previous command line as Port, then hit the Connect button.

N.B. Xamarin Studio's MONODEVELOP_SDB_TEST environment variable has to be set to 1. 

The execution will start to stop as soon as a first breakpoint is encountered. At that point, you can debug your program interactively, executing it step by step and watching its variables.
