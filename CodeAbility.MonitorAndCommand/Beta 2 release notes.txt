Corrected/improved many details: some bugs: 
- when deployed to Mono, some UTF8 encoding implementation differences caused the server to crash when receiving data from a NETMF client; 
- sockets failures do not cause.

Improved reliability

Splitted MFClient project into two projects, one for NETMF 4.2 & one form NETMF 4.3, sharing common code.
 
Added several features to facilitate troubleshooting & debugging: 
- .NET Trace for Core.Server & Core.Client
- logging to a file on the SD card for Core.MFClient;

Added two extra demo projects :
- Demo.Server, extending the Core.Server to present additional monitoring data on a WFP UI; 
- Demo.Netduino3Wifi, sending B18D20 temperature sensor data.
