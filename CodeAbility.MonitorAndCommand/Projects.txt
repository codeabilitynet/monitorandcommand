The solution is made of several project categories :
- Core projects build the core libraries referenced by the Demo, Test and Netduino projects;
- Test projects build Console applications to be used for testing/troubleshooting of the Core projects;
- Netduino projects build libraries referenced by the Demo.Netduino* projects;
- Demo projects build the demo applications used for the "showcase" video.

Core projects
- AzureStorage defines functionalities to store Messages in a Windows Azure' Blob;
- Client defines the core client functionnalities of the middleware for .NET;
- Helpers defines some supporting functionnalities used by the other projects;
- MF42Client compiles the client defined in MFClientShared for NETMF 4.2;
- MF43Client compiles the client defined in MFClientShared for NETMF 4.3;
- MFClientShared defines the core client messaging functionalities for NETMF;
- Models defines the core Message class, and related data, used by the server and clients;
- PortableModels compiles the classes defined in Models as a Portable library to be referenced by the WindowsPhone controller project;
- Server defines the core server functionnalities of the middleware;
- SqlStorage defines functionalities to store Message in a SQL Server Database;
- T-SQL define the SQL Server database for Message storage;
- WcfServiceLibrary define a WCF service receiving Messages to by stored;
- WPClient defines the core client messaging functionalities for WindowsPhone.

Demo projects
- Environment defines the constants used by the messages exchanges by the Demo servers and clients;
- ServerConsole defines a Console application running the Core.Server library;
- WpfServer defines a WPF application running the Core.Server library with extended functionalities;
- WpfMonitor defines a WPF application running a Core.Client library to monitor the messages exchanged by the "demo" devices connected to the server;
- Demo.Netduino3Wifi references the Netduino.DS18B20 library to be run on a Netduino 3 Wifi;
- Demo.NetduinoPlus references the Netduino.LEDs library to be run on a Netduino Plus;
- Demo.MvcApplication defines an ASP.NET MVC application exposing the WcfServiceLibrary and presenting the received data on a Web UI.

Netduino projects
- DS18B20 defines a class providing temperature sensor reading on a DS1820 sensor using OneWire;
- LEDs defines a class providing fake data generation and controlling the state of two LEDs.

Test projects
- DeviceConsole defines a Console application simulating the messages sent and received by Pibrella & Netduino projects;
- MFDeviceConsole defines a NETMF Emulator application simulating the messages sent by the Netduino LEDs project;
- RemoteConsole definie a Console application simulating the messages sent and received by the WindowsPhone remote application.
