If you do not have NETMF/WindowsPhone SDK installed, unload the projects that require it. 

To start the "Test/Demo" environment, in "multiple start up" projects, set "Start" for the following projects:
- Test.ServerConsole;
- Test.DeviceConsole or Demo.WindowsPhoneController;
- Test.RemoteConsole;
- optional, Demo.WpfMonitor;
- optional, if you have a Netduino Plus device connected to the network, Demo.Netduino;

In order for things to work in your environment, you have to set the Ip address of your test machine as the "server address" to which all the devices are pointing.
Except for the Netduino project, which "hardcodes" it, the server Ip address is set in the App.config of the respective projects.
